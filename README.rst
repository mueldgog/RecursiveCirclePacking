Recursive Circle Packing instances
==================================

This repository contains all instances that have been used for the paper "Exact Methods for Recursive Circle Packing",
see https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-zib/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6449.

The randomly generated instances of the paper are contained in 'rand.tar' whereas the real-world instances from the
real-world application in the tube industry is contained in 'real.tar'. Each instances has the following structure

.. code::

    <instance name>
    <number of ring types> <width of each container> <height of each container>
    <number of rings of the first type> <internal radius> <external radius>
    <number of rings of the second type> <internal radius> <external radius>
    ...
